         "FA chief: Wenger has ‘perfect criteria’ for England and Allardyce could face ban",
         "Martin Glenn has said that successful international managers ‘tend to be older’ while claiming the behaviour of former England manager Sam Allardyce ‘could not have been predicted’<br>",
         "Arsène Wenger is one of a handful of managers with the “perfect” criteria to become the next England manager in the wake of Sam Allardyce’s ill-starred tenure, according to the Football Association chief executive. Speaking at length for the first time since Allardyce lost his job, Martin Glenn also confirmed that his humiliation could be compounded with a charge for bringing the game into disrepute and a possible ban. As attention turns to the once again vacant position, Glenn said the criteria had not changed from when Allardyce was appointed in the summer. Related: Arsène Wenger says he is not obsessed by winning one final trophy at Arsenal Asked whether Wenger, who has just completed two decades at Arsenal and is out of contract in the summer, fitted the bill he said: “I am not commenting on that. Of course he’d fit the criteria perfectly. Of course he would, as would a few others.” Glenn also said that successful international managers “tend to be older”. He said: “It doesn’t mean they all have to be but it tends to be they’ve had an experience in the game and the average age of a successful manager is probably in their 60s. That’s a fact, it doesn’t have to be an overriding one.” Glenn, who said that the stand-in, Gareth Southgate, was a “genuine contender”, added that while being English was “a bonus” it was not a prerequisite and that Premier League experience was “preferable”. Wenger, meanwhile, talking before Glenn on Friday, had seemed to distance himself from the position, when asked whether he still believes that the FA should steer clear of hiring a foreigner. “I know God Save the Queen,” he said. “But I still think that the priority is for an Englishman to manage England. Because it looked always a bit bizarre if I manage England and play against France. I cannot sing the French national anthem and not the English one. It looks strange.” Wenger was asked if he feels English rather than French these days. “I think a big part when I come back to London, I come back to home,” he said. “I’m not English, I am French. I feel French as well. But of course you do not spend 20 years in a country without identifying or getting used to some values or behaviours of the local culture. “I do not want to give you some fruit for speculation. I am completely committed on the immediate. The priority is this club and what we want to achieve together until the end of the season.” As one of a trio of FA executives who decided to appoint Allardyce following England’s Euro 2016 humiliation, Glenn defended the process that led to the decision. He claimed the FA performed adequate due diligence and that he was not to blame for Allardyce’s “colossal error of judgment” during a meeting with undercover reporters from the Daily Telegraph. Echoing the words of the FA chairman, Greg Clarke, this week, Glenn also said he felt personally let down. “The easy decision was to keep him and tough it out. I do feel let down because I genuinely think for football reasons he was a really good choice and just what we needed after the Euros,” he said. Sam Allardyce quits as England manager after just 67 days Glenn said the right questions were asked during the appointment process about Allardyce’s past, including the Quest inquiry into football transfers in 2006 that coincided with allegations over transfer irregularities made in a BBC Panorama programme. Allardyce denied any wrongdoing. “We knew he was a man of the world, we knew there had been a Panorama inquiry a few years ago. But he was a guy who had a senior position on the League Managers’ Association. Known in the game,” said Glenn. “We referenced him widely. He’s Sam, he’s loud, he’s brash but he is in the middle of the fairway in terms of behaviour. So I think thatthe reason I felt let down was, I guess, the surprise factor of it.” Asked specifically about the fact that of the 17 transfers that were not signed off by the Quest inquiry, three related to players signed by Allardyce at Bolton Wanderers, Glenn said it was discussed at the interview and the FA’s integrity unit had no outstanding concerns. “He was seen to be a stalwart of the game. Yes he’s Sam and he’s loud so we did understand that he’s not going to be the quietest person,” said Glenn. “But you could not have predicted that behaviour. I take full responsibility for the decision to hire him but I don’t take responsibility for his actions.” Glenn said his disappointment was compounded by the fact Allardyce was specifically spoken to about his responsibilities and the need to assume everything he said could be made public shortly after his appointment. “It wasn’t the case that he was left like an innocent in the woods. Which is why the thing was ever more a surprise,” he said. “Every time there was a marginal call we judged we would have Sam Allardyce thrown back at us every time,” said Glenn, arguing that Allardyce’s advice on how to circumvent rules on third party ownership left the FA with little choice. “If you are there to be the rule enforcer of the game it is an impossible position,” he said. The FA, which recently began a review of its integrity unit that is likely to result in changes before next season, could charge Allardyce with bringing the game into disrepute. “It could range from a fine to a ban. That’s what the history shows. That’s for a tribunal to decide,” Glenn added.",

         "Mauricio Pochettino to face Guardiola as an equal in a rivalry born in Barcelona",
         "Mauricio Pochettino, as a player and a manager of Espanyol, always felt like the underdog against Barça’s Pep Guardiola but now it looks a level playing field",
         "Mauricio Pochettino remembers the way that the eyes of his players had widened in astonishment. Or, perhaps, it was fear. He had taken over at relegation-threatened Espanyol, it was late-January 2009 and his first game in charge – his first of any kind in football management – was at home to Barcelona in the Copa del Rey. It was Pep Guardiola’s Barcelona, the team of Messi, Xavi and Iniesta – and the one that would finish the season with the treble. Related: Pep Guardiola: Tottenham’s Mauricio Pochettino is one of world’s best managers “My first training session had been on the afternoon before the game and then, we trained on the morning of it,” said the Tottenham Hotspur manager. “It was two training sessions in less than 12 hours. I said to the players that we needed to play with high pressing and one-versus-one at the back. Their eyes were like this! They thought it was impossible against Barcelona but I said: ‘No, it is not impossible.’” Against the odds, Espanyol would draw 0-0. Pochettino’s managerial career was up and running. In the away leg the following week, Espanyol lost 3-2 and, when Pochettino took his team back to the Camp Nou in La Liga at the end of February, he was still searching for his first win. On a memorable occasion, they would win 2-1 . Espanyol have not beaten Barcelona since. “The 0-0 against Barcelona was a fantastic result and it was then easy to convince the players to play in a different way,” Pochettino said. “Where did I get the idea we had to press them? It’s about your personality, who you are. You show on the pitch who you are. If you are brave in your life, you cannot behave in a different way on the pitch. I don’t understand how to play in a different way. Always, be brave. I like to be brave.” Pochettino had many battles with Guardiola when they were players with Espanyol and Barcelona respectively, and many more once they had crossed over into management at the two clubs. Pochettino was a part of the Espanyol team that beat Sir Bobby Robson’s Barcelona 2-0 at home in 1997 and there is footage of him on YouTube monstering into a challenge on the Brazilian Ronaldo. But that match, plus his first victory in management, have represented his only successes against Guardiola, who brings his Manchester City team to White Hart Lane on Sunday for a top-of-the-table collision. Pochettino won 4-1 in the corresponding fixture last September , when City were managed by Manuel Pellegrini, and it was a result that energised Tottenham. But it feels as though the stakes have been raised again, largely because, well, City have Guardiola and they have looked imperious this season. It will be another occasion when Pochettino demands bravery from his players and another one in which he will hope to see evidence that they can get the better of a powerhouse. Pochettino’s stated aim for the season is to win the title. “The big challenge for us is to try to win the league,” he said, two weeks ago. On Friday, he was quick to say that nobody ought to read too much into the City result. It remained too early in the season, he said. But imagine the reaction if Tottenham were to win? Pochettino’s team have started well and there are a clutch of factors that fire the belief that it could be their year, chief among them the sense that, despite their lofty early season position, they have not yet truly clicked – apart from in the 4-0 win at Stoke City . They have dug out most of their results, showing plenty of personality. There is more to come, which is a good sign. Related: Tottenham Hotspur v Manchester City: match preview Pochettino’s squad also has greater strength in depth, following the club’s summer transfer business, which was characterised by the desire to build from a position – and in positions – of strength. The club had excellent midfielders last season but they still spent a combined £41m on Victor Wanyama and Moussa Sissoko. More than ever, with the demands of a Champions League campaign, it is a squad game, and the squad was needed on Tuesday. Pochettino was without five key players for the high-pressure Champions League tie at CSKA Moscow but a remark from Hugo Lloris spoke volumes. “From the first minute I saw the teamsheet, I never thought about the missing players,” the captain said. Tottenham won 1-0. Pochettino’s promotion of academy-developed players has created a connection with the fans and a feelgood factor, and then there is the defence, which was the joint-most miserly in last season’s Premier League and is the most miserly so far this time. Jan Vertonghen notes how he has played “maybe three-quarters” of his career matches with Toby Alderweireld, his Belgium and former Ajax team-mate, and their central defensive partnership has come to be characterised by steel and understanding. Title-winning teams are built on strong centre-half pairings and they are ready to take on Sergio Agüero, who has 10 goals in nine league games against Tottenham. The Champions League has brought excitement and opportunity but also tremendous extra pressure, both mental and physical. It felt significant, and a little worrying, that Eric Dier and Mousa Dembélé both suffered injuries against Sunderland after the Champions League opener against Monaco. Pochettino has spoken about how there will be less rotation this season, because players are not OK about sitting out Champions League ties. Related: Pep Guardiola tells Manchester City players effort levels must not drop Tottenham’s biggest concern, at present, involves the lack of clinical edge – can Vincent Janssen score enough goals in the absence of the injured Harry Kane? – while there is the wider question of whether their rivals might simply be driving improvements at quicker rates. Ahead of City’s visit, though, the rhetoric from the dressing-room was heavy on self-belief. “It’s true that the Guardiola effect took place very early at City but we are more focused on ourselves,” Lloris said. “We know that we are able to do great things against top teams. In front of our crowd, anything is possible.” Pochettino’s duel with Guardiola is one of the principal subplots and the paths that they have taken to Sunday’s showdown have been markedly different. Shortly before he got the Espanyol job, Pochettino completed his Uefa Pro License with a spell as the assistant manager to the club’s ladies’ team while after Espanyol he took over at Southampton, who had also been in a lowly position. Guardiola, by contrast, went from Barcelona B to Barcelona, where he inherited Messi & Co. “Guardiola is the face of a new managerial era, in which the vision of romantic football was mixed with [the appliance of] new technology,” Pochettino said. “He is the face but it’s not only Guardiola. I have been involved and [so have] different managers like Luis Enrique and Diego Simeone. We are the same age and in the same level. Guardiola was the face because [good] results always put you at the top. I think always you can see better when you have Messi in your team.” It is not difficult to detect professional tension between Pochettino, the fighting Argentinian, and Guardiola, the gilded son of Catalonia. The playing field feels more level than when they met in Spain. Pochettino is determined to make a statement.",

         "Chelsea’s Antonio Conte says he has no magic wand to solve team’s problems",
         "Antonio Conte has said he cannot wave ‘a magic wand’ to solve the defensive issues which have undermined Chelsea’s progress this season",
         "Antonio Conte has warned there can be no quick fix to solve Chelsea’s underlying problems this season and stressed the need for patience in a series of face-to-face meetings with the owner, Roman Abramovich, at the club’s base in Cobham. Abramovich was present to watch the first team train three times this week, meeting Conte over lunch in the facility’s canteen on each occasion to discuss the manager’s plans to revive a flagging side. The owner, who has made 11 managerial changes in 13 years, remains supportive of the Italian and sympathetic as to the scale of the task, exposed by defeats by Liverpool and Arsenal in their past two Premier League matches. There is a willingness to fund significant purchases in future transfer windows, as well as to move on those senior players who have underachieved over the last 14 months but Conte, who has practised with a back three in training this week, is painfully realistic about the need for time to work on improving the current crop. “It’s not a surprise,” he said when asked whether he had anticipated that the team might toil after his appointment in July. “Usually, when you change manager, it means you have a problem. So, when you arrive at the place who called you to solve their problems, you know you must face this situation. “Sometimes you can be happy and solve the situation very quickly. Sometimes you need to have time to solve the situation. It’s important to understand how many problems you find when you arrive in a new team. “In my life my story shows that I haven’t ever found an easy situation [when I’ve come in]. Even so, there was an expectation to improve on last season. That was my expectation too. But my experience, as a footballer and a manager, tells me to have a bit of patience to continue to work, to improve, to find the right way and solve things. It won’t be easy. It’s normal but I’m confident. I have a group of players who want to work and show the right commitment.” Conte would appear to have faced similar issues when he returned to Juventus, where his career as a player had flourished, as manager in 2011. He had inherited a squad who had finished seventh in successive campaigns and famously, on his first day in charge, assembled his new players to deliver the succinct message: “Lads, it’s time we stopped being shit.” Conte vented his anger at his Chelsea team at half-time at the Emirates Stadium last Saturday, when the visitors already trailed 3-0, with his frustration born partly out of the fact he considers this group more talented than the side he took over in Turin. “Juventus, for two years, had finished seventh and the value of the players is not the same,” he said. “The talent that there is now in our team, at Chelsea, for sure is more than Juventus in my first season. But, also, we must understand that you don’t win just with talent. With talent you must add running, intensity, sacrifice, wanting to win the ball when you lose it … all of this. We are working very hard on these aspects to improve them. It’s important to understand and find very quickly the right way. “If we think we can solve this situation without work, because we have a magician [in charge] … well, it’s not my habit to hope to improve the situation without work. I think the situation we can improve only with work, with great work. We are doing this. In these two months we are doing this. Slowly, slowly, we are understanding this. I’m confident I have a group of players who have great commitment and who work hard.” Chelsea will still be without John Terry at Hull City on Saturday as the captain continues his rehabilitation from ankle ligament damage. Conte has experimented playing David Luiz, Gary Cahill and Branislav Ivanovic in a back three in training, and will consider handing Marcos Alonso his first Premier League start for the club at the KCom Stadium. The Italian could become the first Chelsea manager to drop Ivanovic from his lineup on the basis of poor form since André Villas-Boas in 2013. Regardless, Cahill, whose error at Arsenal handed the hosts their opening goal, will retain his place. “I don’t like to single out players for individual mistakes,” Conte said. “We lose and we win together. We must understand this. If someone makes a mistake, together we must help him and solve the situation. Against Arsenal we had 80 minutes to recover from the mistake. Cahill is a good player, a great defender. I trust him and he plays tomorrow.” Related: Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekend",

         "David Moyes is on a mission to prove that managing Sunderland is not an ‘impossible job’ after all as he seeks his first Premier League win in charge of the north-east club",
         "David Moyes is on a mission to prove that managing Sunderland is not “the impossible job” after all as he seeks his first Premier League win since replacing Sam Allardyce in July. “I want to succeed here,” said Sunderland’s seventh manager in five years as his bottom-placed side prepared for Saturday’s home game with West Bromwich Albion without the injured Adnan Januzaj and Lee Cattermole. “There’s a big job to be done here but I don’t think it’s impossible. There’s an awful lot of things needing to be fixed at this club but I think they can be fixed, I really do.” Related: Sunderland v West Bromwich Albion: match preview Moyes believes the rapid turnover in managers – it is a year since Dick Advocaat resigned in despair – explains Sunderland’s constant battles against relegation. “The revolving door needs to be stopped,” he said. “Things need to be put right but to change them there needs to be a period of stability.” He sets great store by “honesty” and the team’s supporters and players are having to accept his refusal to sugar coat reality. “My words could be interpreted as too downbeat,” Moyes acknowledged after pointing out that Januzaj’s absence for a minimum of six weeks with ankle ligament damage will hardly enhance his side’s creativity. “But honest is all I can be. I think people would rather you tell the truth than untruths. “The players have had to take criticism from me. We need a really committed team and a team that can concentrate. At the moment I don’t know what I’m going to get from my team.” Moyes is unsure how Cattermole – who has had an epidural injection in an attempt to ease a back problem which causes him severe leg pain – will be absent for, but he is adamant that the recent resignations of Ishtiaq Rehman, Sunderland’s former doctor, and Danny Philpott, the assistant academy director, should not reflect badly on the club. Related: Sunderland doctor leaves club following Patrick van Aanholt incident “The doctor situation was something I was aware of before I came in,” he said. “He’s had some really difficult decisions in recent weeks and I think his feeling is maybe that it was time to go. Danny Philpott had come in with the idea of getting the main [academy] job but they [Sunderland’s board] didn’t want that. Whatever decisions are made, the club will only ever do things for the best. Martin [Bain, the chief executive] is a correct fella. I can only say, anything he’s doing, he’s doing for the right reasons.” In the wake of this week’s revelations regarding alleged corruption in football, Moyes has called for great transfer market transparency. “When a transfer is completed let’s get what the club has had to pay the agent straight out there,” he said. “I think there might be a few gasps from supporters and the media. “I’m not condoning what’s been revealed this week but it might actually be small stuff compared to what else is going on, to some of the money being given to agents to do deals. I’m amazed at how many agents are representing the same player – there could be 25 and they say they’re acting as ‘intermediaries’. Maybe that’s why the agents’ fees are bigger, because everyone’s getting paid down the line – this year’s been one of the worst for that.”",

         "Pep Guardiola has warned Manchester City’s players that each match is the ‘most important 90 minutes of their lives’ and that he will leave them out if there is any drop in level",
         "Pep Guardiola has warned Manchester City’s players that each match is the “most important 90 minutes of their lives” and that he will leave them out if there is any drop in level. Guardiola takes City to Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday in a game that features his Premier League leaders against Mauricio Pochettino’s second-placed side. City drew 3-3 at Celtic in Wednesday’s Champions League group game to end their run of victories at 10. Afterwards Fernandinho said Guardiola’s insistence on a high intensity in training and matches meant “sometimes we go a little bit down, sometimes we are up”, though he added that squad and coach were working to attain the requisite level. Related: Mauricio Pochettino to face Guardiola as an equal in a rivalry born in Barcelona The Brazilian’s comments regarding the dip in quality were put to Guardiola and he was asked if this was acceptable. “No. I don’t accept that,” the 45-year-old said. “I wouldn’t be happy. I want it to be the principle in all of our games. “That’s why the player has to take care of themselves in their private life, sleep well, eat well, because the way we play is so demanding. People cannot escape; [if they do not take care] another one has to be there. The way I want to play is that way and it’s much more simple to improve. But for the 90 minutes the players have to put in absolutely everything on the field. That’s the most important moment in their lives. Training is a part of it but the most important thing is the referee’s whistle and you start to play.” Guardiola was proud of his players’ effort at Parkhead. “The fans for Man City were disappointed because they didn’t win but were happy with what they saw,” he said. “They saw until the last moment they tried to win. That is what I am after – until the last minute try to win the games; it doesn’t matter what happened. At the end I went to the locker room and I think the players were tired, they were exhausted, so much so that they couldn’t talk and that is what I want from my players because in the end all our fans know that and that is why I cannot be disappointed in our performance in Glasgow.” Guardiola is an admirer of Pochettino and the high-pressing football Spurs play. “What I saw with Tottenham is one who, along with Liverpool, one of the best teams at the moment playing in the Premier League,” he said. “We need a good performance to win there. We cannot achieve points if we are not making a good performance. If you are so-so, no chance. “What I like is the teams who are active and you see that when they play. They want the ball, want to keep it, are so aggressive without the ball. I like to see that and Tottenham and Liverpool are both teams in that way.” Despite winning all previous six league matches Guardiola remains guarded. “We won most of our games because of our enthusiasm,” he said. “At the start a new coach wins a lot of games but to create something stable, more controlled, you need more time. In my first year in Barcelona we won six titles [trophies] in a row but by my fourth year we were better than my first year. “In my third year in Munich we were better than my first year. You see the teams and the way we play. I am pretty sure that in my second and third year here we will be better than we are now. The results are almost perfect now but the performances will improve more over time. Now we won six games in a row and people say we are going to win four titles in the first season. “How many clubs have done that in their first season? How many? Zero. It is so difficult. We are going to try to win the game but in my last period here the football will be better. I am sure of that.” Guardiola is conscious that by the second year the initial enthusiasm that players show for a coach wanes, making it important to have laid solid foundations regarding the ethos. “Pochettino is better now than when he arrived because he had time and we need time but we sometimes don’t get time. That is the big problem we have. That is why the enthusiasm is so important. In the second year the enthusiasm is gone, it disappears, that is going to happen. I am tired of the players, they are tired of me.” Guardiola has a three-year contract and indicated when he may decide to stay longer. “When I decided to say goodbye to Barcelona and Bayern Munich I decided in the last year,” he said. “I said: ‘OK, it’s enough.’”",

Jarrod Bowenbelieves he is in competition withCole PalmerandPhil Fodenfor a place in England’s World Cup squad. TheWest Hamcaptain said he is trying to give managerThomas Tuchela selection headache but, withBukayo Sakaestablished as the first-choice right winger, Bowen sees abattle to get a spot on the plane next summer. Noni Madueke, who excelled in September’s wins over Andorra and Serbia, is also in contention and while Tuchel has talked about using Foden as a No9 or a No10, Bowen feels he could be a rival on the right. “What I'm up against is Bukayo, Noni is injured for this camp, Cole Palmer, Phil Foden can all play there - you're talking about world-class, elite players and I'm in the same category as them,” he said. “Bukayo has proved it at international and club level. For me it's about keeping pushing myself and keep pushing Bukayo as well. Give the manager a headache and give Bukayo a headache as well.” Bowen hopes his ability to play in several positions will count in his favour. Although he rarely plays on the left for his club, he spent some ofSunday’s 2-0 win in Albaniathere after beginning on the right while he often operates as a centre-forward for West Ham. “I am not going to stake my claim and say that I am better than Harry Kane,” he added. “They are big shoes to fill. But that is one thing about me, my versatility. I was played out the left for 20 minutes when Bukayo came on. The manager has noticed that about me. He has noticed that hunger, that drive that wherever it is on the pitch, I will run. Maybe not left-back or right-back as that would be a little more confusing but anywhere across the front line I am comfortable playing.” Bowen said he has had to fight off an inferiority complex to believe he belongs on the international stage. He began his career in non-league football and is now dreaming of going to the World Cup. “I never thought I would play professional football, that's the bottom line,” he explained. “I came up from Hereford, came up from the Conference, never thought I'd be stood here talking about my 20th cap. It can be overwhelming with England but you need to tell yourself you're not here to make the numbers up, you're here on merit for what you've done on a consistent level. “It is the pinnacle of any player’s career to be playing at the highest level. I was lucky to experience a Euros and a World Cup would be that extra step.” Join thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies Please refresh the page or navigate to another page on the site to be automatically logged inPlease refresh your browser to be logged in",

We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it. Northern Irelandconcluded their World Cup qualifying Group A campaign with a lacklustre 1-0 victory over Luxembourg at a subdued Windsor Park, courtesy of Jamie Donley's first international goal. Donley, making his first competitive start for Northern Ireland, dispatched a 44th-minute penalty, sending Anthony Moris the wrong way after Christopher Martins fouled Ciaron Brown in the box. This solitary strike proved sufficient to settle a largely uninspiring encounter. The home side had initially harboured hopes of securing second place in the group, but Friday’s 1-0 defeat to Slovakia rendered this fixture a dead-rubber. Despite the anticlimactic end to the qualifiers, Northern Ireland can still look forward to a play-off spot in March, a reward for their Nations League group triumph last year. Michael O’Neill made six changes, handing Jamie McDonnell his first start, replacing the injured Bailey Peacock-Farrell with Conor Hazard and also bringing in Donley, Brown, Jamal Lewis and Ethan Galbraith, back from suspension. The manager left out Trai Hume completely and kept Justin Devenny and Josh Magennis on the bench, citing the risk of suspension for the play-off semi-final amid uncertainty over the regulations for those already on a yellow card. On Sunday the Northern Ireland manager said his request for clarification on the rules had gone unanswered, but the official team-sheet showed there were no players, including those on a yellow, at risk of a ban. After a minute’s applause in memory of George Best, who died 20 years ago this month, the match kicked off in an atmosphere becoming of a game with nothing riding on it. Isaac Price hit a volley straight at Moris in the ninth minute before a neat move started by Donley and involving Galbraith and Price ended with Lewis, making his first international appearance in 13 months, blazing over. Fans were off their seats in the 17th minute when Donley turned in from Galbraith’s cross, but it was ruled out with latter being in an offside position in the build-up. Luxembourg, whose only goal of a miserable campaign came in September’s 3-1 loss to Northern Ireland, threatened as Christopher Martins was denied by a good save from Hazard, making his first competitive start in more than two years. Moments later, Dirk Carlson swept wide. But it was pretty tepid stuff until five minutes before half-time when referee Kristo Tohver was sent to the screen by VAR Bram Van Driessche, who had spotted Martins catching Brown with his boot. There had been half-hearted appeals from Northern Ireland players, who were busy watching Price fire wide from the edge of the box, but the penalty was given to the fury of Luxembourg. Both Moris and coach Dan Huet – who stepped in for the suspended Jeff Strasser on the touchline – were booked for their protests before Donley stepped up to score Northern Ireland’s 100th World Cup qualifying goal at Windsor Park. Amid a number of second-half changes there was an 86th cap for Magennis that moves him level with Keith Gillespie as Northern Ireland’s 10th most-capped players and a debut for Barnsley’s Patrick Kelly, but a poor contest was petering out. It ended with Luxembourg appealing for a penalty as Benfica’s Leandro Barreiro tumbled under a challenge from Kelly, but Tohver waved away their protests as the final whistle blew.

The play-offs will be played in single-leg knockout matches, with the draw determining the path.

We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it. The 48 nations competing at the 2026 World Cup will discover their group stage opponents when the draw takes place on 5 December. The tournament will bethe first to feature 48 teams, expanded from 32 in Qatar, and will also be the first World Cup to be hosted by three countries. The majority of 104 games will be staged in theUSA(78), withMexicoandCanadahosting 13 each. The World Cup will begin on 11 June in Mexico’s historic Azteca Stadium, the scene of Brazil’s 1970 glory inspired by Pele and Argentina’s success in 1986 led by Diego Maradona. It will conclude with the final on 19 July at the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey. Here is everything you need to know. The draw for the 2026 World Cup will take place at5pm GMT/12pm ESTonFriday 5 December, at the Kennedy Center in Washington DC. The US presidentDonald Trumpis expected to be in attendance. The 48 nations will be divided into 12 groups containing four teams each, one from each of four draw pots. Pot one will contain the three host nations – USA, Canada and Mexico – plus the nine top countries in the Fifa world rankings who have qualified for the tournament. Already, Mexico have been assigned Group A, Canada to Group B and the USA to Group C. Pots two, three and four will contain the next 12 best-ranked sides in order so that, theoretically, the groups will be balanced and the best teams will be kept separate until the knockout rounds. Teams from the same confederation will be kept apart in the group stage, except for Europe where there are more teams (16) than groups. No group will have more than two European nations. The top two finishers in each group will qualify automatically for the last-32, along with the eight best third-placed teams. The ranking of the third-placed teams will be determined by points, then goal difference, then goals scored. If two or more teams are still level, then “team conduct scores” will come into play (a yellow card is minus one point, a red card via two yellow cards is minus three points, and a straight red card is minus four). If still equal, the team with the highest world ranking will progress. Each continental confederation has a set number of nations taking part in the World Cup to decide the first 46 spots. Then a play-off competition will decide the reamining two places. Uefa (Europe):16 spots CAF (Africa):9 spots AFC (Asia):8 spots Conmebol (South America):6 spots Concacaf (North America):6 spots (including three hosts) OFC (Oceania):1 spot Aninter-confederation play-off competitionwill take place to decide which two additional teams will qualify. Six nations will enter the play-offs: one from CAF, one from AFC, one from OFC, one from Conmebol and two from Concacaf, competing for the last two spots at the World Cup. The inter-confederation play-offs take place in March.

And unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock Americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it. World Cupqualifying is hurtling towards a conclusion with some of the final places ahead of the tournament in the United States, Canada and Mexico up for grabs over the coming days. So far, 34 teams have booked their places in what has already been a historic campaign for three first-time qualifiers, with Jordan, Uzbekistanand the Cape Verde islandsall through to the 48-team finals. England, France, Croatia, Portugal, Norway, Germany and the Netherlands have all qualified this week and there are only a few groups left to complete as the first round of qualifying finally concludes. Elsewhere, we have largely reached play-off time across the rest of the world; and that’sbefore the rest of the European play-offsand inter-continental play-offs in March. Confusingly, those games will take place afterthe World Cup draw is made on Friday 5 December. Qualifying places available: 16 Teams already qualified:England, France, Croatia, Portugal, Norway, Germany, Netherlands With England, France, Croatia, Portugal,Norway, Germany and Netherlands throughthe other group winners (who all receive a direct pass to the World Cup) will be confirmed over the final two rounds of qualifying. The 12 group runners-up then go through to the play-offs in March, alongside four teams who earned a play-off spot with their Nations League performances, and four more teams will qualify for the World Cup. This requires a group-by-group breakdown. GermanythrashedSlovakiain the group decider to qualify automatically, with Slovakia going through to the play-offs.Northern Ireland, who finished third, are also into the play-offs. Switzerlandare set to qualify automatically, given they have a three-point lead overKosovoplus a massive advantage in goal difference. Switzerland beat 4-1 Sweden on Saturday and now travel toKosovo– who will be in the play-offs – on the final day. Sweden haveparachuted in Graham Potterand they will go into the play-offs thanks to their Nations League performances. Scotlandwere beaten 3-2 inGreeceon Saturday night to seemingly throw away their hopes of automatic World Cup qualification, only forBelarusto stunDenmarkwith a 2-2 draw and keep the group alive. Steve Clarke’s side will now meet Denmark at Hampden Park on Tuesday night in a huge showdown to decide who books their place at the World Cup and who has to settle for the play-offs. Scotland must win, or else the Danes will take top spot. Franceare through after beating second-placedUkraine4-0 at the Parc des Princes on Thursday. Ukraine then beatIceland2-0 to book a play-off spot. Spainare looking pretty a three-point lead overTurkeyand a massive advantage in goal difference. Their win againstGeorgiaon Saturday was enough to lock in qualification,barring a major collapse at home againstTurkeyon Tuesday. Turkey will be in the play-offs. Oh my goodness. AfterIreland’sstunning winoverPortugalrevived their hopes ahead of a must-win trip toHungary, Troy Parrott completed his hat-trick in the final minute to send the Irish into the play-offs at the expense of the hosts, who were seconds from going through.Without the suspended Cristiano Ronaldo, Portugal wrapped up top spot with a 9-1 win overArmenia. TheNetherlandshad all but qualified after their draw againstPolandand finished the job againstLithuaniaon the final day, while Poland locked up second place and thus a play-off spot. This will go down to the wire with first-placedAustriahosting second-placedBosnia and Herzegovinaon Tuesday. Bosnia are two points behind and must win to steal the automatic qualification place. Norwaycelebrated their return to a men’s World Cup with a 4-1 win atItaly, who go through to the World Cup play-offs for the third consecutive time. The Italians, four-time World Cup winners, have fallen at that hurdle the past two times. Belgiumare set to qualify automatically for the World Cup, as they lead the group by two points and play minnowsLiechtensteinin their final game on Tuesday. Walesare level on points with second-placedNorthMacedonia, who the Welsh host on Tuesday night. That game is crucial as it will decide who goes through to the play-offs. Englandare through as group winners andAlbaniahave claimed the play-off spot ahead ofSerbia, who lost2-0 at Wembleyon Thursday night. Croatiabecame the third European team, after England and France, to book their spot at the World Cup with a come-from-behind 3-1 win over surprise package theFaroe Islandson Friday evening.Czech Republicgo into the play-offs. Qualifying places available: Six (including three hosts USA, Canada and Mexico), plus two into intercontinental play-offs Teams already qualified: None through qualifying (USA, Canada and Mexico automatically as co-hosts) The three group winners, who qualify directly for the World Cup, will be decided over these upcoming two rounds of qualifying matches, as will the trio of group runners-up, with the best two of those reaching the intercontinental play-offs. It comes down a straight shoot-out in Group A betweenSurinameandPanama.Suriname have never qualified for the World Cup and play the already-eliminatedGuatemalain their final game, while Panama play El Salvador. Suriname and Panama are level on points but Suriname’s goal difference is +5 to Panama’s +2. It’s a big week for Steve McClaren’sJamaica,but it’sCuracaowho are just one win away from qualifying for the World Cup for the first time. The two times play each other in Kingston on Tuesday. Jamaica need to win and the tiny island nation of Curacao need to avoid defeat. Honduras,Costa RicaandHaitiall have the chance to qualify going into the final round of games. Honduras are level on points with Haiti, with both teams two points ahead of Costa Rica. But Costa Rica host Honduras so can leapfrog them with a win, but would only qualify if Haiti slipped up against already-eliminated Nicaragua. Honduras have a better goal difference than Haiti so need to better their result. Haiti will be safely through with a win and Costa Rico and Honduras draw. Qualifying places available: Nine, plus one into intercontinental play-offs Teams already qualified: Morocco, Tunisia, Egypt, Algeria, Ghana, Cape Verde, South Africa, Senegal, Ivory Coast DR CongostunnedNigeriato win the CAF play-off final, with captain Chancel Mbemba, who scored the winner againstCameroonin the semi-finals, sending them through to March’s inter-continental play-offs. Qualifying places available: Eight, plus one into intercontinental play-offs Teams qualified: Japan, Iran, Uzbekistan, South Korea, Jordan, Australia, Saudi Arabia, Qatar TheUnited Arab EmiratesareplayingIraqacross two legs to determine who goes through to the intercontinental qualifiers. The first leg was drawn 1-1 on Thursday, and the second leg will be played in Basra on Tuesday. Qualifying places available: Six, plus one into intercontinental play-offs Teams qualified: Argentina, Brazil, Ecuador, Uruguay, Colombia, Paraguay This was completed ages ago. World Cup champions Argentina became the first side to qualify, with Ecuador finishing as surprise runners-up. Brazil went through despite finishing fifth, with Colombia, Uruguay and Paraguay also advancing.Bolivia, who finished seventh, will enter the intercontinental play-offs. Qualifying places available: One, plus one into intercontinental play-offs Teams qualified: New Zealand New Zealand have been the first benefactors of the expanded tournament, as they have automatically qualified for the 2026 edition via the only place available to Oceanic nations rather than having to go through the intercontinental playoffs as at previous editions. Qualifying has already ended, withNew Caledoniahaving earned a place in the intercontinental play-offs.

         "FA chief: Wenger has ‘perfect criteria’ for England and Allardyce could face ban \nFA chief: Wenger has ‘perfect criteria’ for England and Allardyce could face ban \nMartin Glenn has said that successful international managers ‘tend to be older’ while claiming the behaviour of former England manager Sam Allardyce ‘could not have been predicted’<br> \nArsène Wenger is one of a handful of managers with the “perfect” criteria to become the next England manager in the wake of Sam Allardyce’s ill-starred tenure, according to the Football Association chief executive. Speaking at length for the first time since Allardyce lost his job, Martin Glenn also confirmed that his humiliation could be compounded with a charge for bringing the game into disrepute and a possible ban. As attention turns to the once again vacant position, Glenn said the criteria had not changed from when Allardyce was appointed in the summer. Related: Arsène Wenger says he is not obsessed by winning one final trophy at Arsenal Asked whether Wenger, who has just completed two decades at Arsenal and is out of contract in the summer, fitted the bill he said: “I am not commenting on that. Of course he’d fit the criteria perfectly. Of course he would, as would a few others.” Glenn also said that successful international managers “tend to be older”. He said: “It doesn’t mean they all have to be but it tends to be they’ve had an experience in the game and the average age of a successful manager is probably in their 60s. That’s a fact, it doesn’t have to be an overriding one.” Glenn, who said that the stand-in, Gareth Southgate, was a “genuine contender”, added that while being English was “a bonus” it was not a prerequisite and that Premier League experience was “preferable”. Wenger, meanwhile, talking before Glenn on Friday, had seemed to distance himself from the position, when asked whether he still believes that the FA should steer clear of hiring a foreigner. “I know God Save the Queen,” he said. “But I still think that the priority is for an Englishman to manage England. Because it looked always a bit bizarre if I manage England and play against France. I cannot sing the French national anthem and not the English one. It looks strange.” Wenger was asked if he feels English rather than French these days. “I think a big part when I come back to London, I come back to home,” he said. “I’m not English, I am French. I feel French as well. But of course you do not spend 20 years in a country without identifying or getting used to some values or behaviours of the local culture. “I do not want to give you some fruit for speculation. I am completely committed on the immediate. The priority is this club and what we want to achieve together until the end of the season.” As one of a trio of FA executives who decided to appoint Allardyce following England’s Euro 2016 humiliation, Glenn defended the process that led to the decision. He claimed the FA performed adequate due diligence and that he was not to blame for Allardyce’s “colossal error of judgment” during a meeting with undercover reporters from the Daily Telegraph. Echoing the words of the FA chairman, Greg Clarke, this week, Glenn also said he felt personally let down. “The easy decision was to keep him and tough it out. I do feel let down because I genuinely think for football reasons he was a really good choice and just what we needed after the Euros,” he said. Sam Allardyce quits as England manager after just 67 days Glenn said the right questions were asked during the appointment process about Allardyce’s past, including the Quest inquiry into football transfers in 2006 that coincided with allegations over transfer irregularities made in a BBC Panorama programme. Allardyce denied any wrongdoing. “We knew he was a man of the world, we knew there had been a Panorama inquiry a few years ago. But he was a guy who had a senior position on the League Managers’ Association. Known in the game,” said Glenn. “We referenced him widely. He’s Sam, he’s loud, he’s brash but he is in the middle of the fairway in terms of behaviour. So I think thatthe reason I felt let down was, I guess, the surprise factor of it.” Asked specifically about the fact that of the 17 transfers that were not signed off by the Quest inquiry, three related to players signed by Allardyce at Bolton Wanderers, Glenn said it was discussed at the interview and the FA’s integrity unit had no outstanding concerns. “He was seen to be a stalwart of the game. Yes he’s Sam and he’s loud so we did understand that he’s not going to be the quietest person,” said Glenn. “But you could not have predicted that behaviour. I take full responsibility for the decision to hire him but I don’t take responsibility for his actions.” Glenn said his disappointment was compounded by the fact Allardyce was specifically spoken to about his responsibilities and the need to assume everything he said could be made public shortly after his appointment. “It wasn’t the case that he was left like an innocent in the woods. Which is why the thing was ever more a surprise,” he said. “Every time there was a marginal call we judged we would have Sam Allardyce thrown back at us every time,” said Glenn, arguing that Allardyce’s advice on how to circumvent rules on third party ownership left the FA with little choice. “If you are there to be the rule enforcer of the game it is an impossible position,” he said. The FA, which recently began a review of its integrity unit that is likely to result in changes before next season, could charge Allardyce with bringing the game into disrepute. “It could range from a fine to a ban. That’s what the history shows. That’s for a tribunal to decide,” Glenn added."

         "Mauricio Pochettino to face Guardiola as an equal in a rivalry born in Barcelona \nMauricio Pochettino to face Guardiola as an equal in a rivalry born in Barcelona \nMauricio Pochettino, as a player and a manager of Espanyol, always felt like the underdog against Barça’s Pep Guardiola but now it looks a level playing field \nMauricio Pochettino remembers the way that the eyes of his players had widened in astonishment. Or, perhaps, it was fear. He had taken over at relegation-threatened Espanyol, it was late-January 2009 and his first game in charge – his first of any kind in football management – was at home to Barcelona in the Copa del Rey. It was Pep Guardiola’s Barcelona, the team of Messi, Xavi and Iniesta – and the one that would finish the season with the treble. Related: Pep Guardiola: Tottenham’s Mauricio Pochettino is one of world’s best managers “My first training session had been on the afternoon before the game and then, we trained on the morning of it,” said the Tottenham Hotspur manager. “It was two training sessions in less than 12 hours. I said to the players that we needed to play with high pressing and one-versus-one at the back. Their eyes were like this! They thought it was impossible against Barcelona but I said: ‘No, it is not impossible.’” Against the odds, Espanyol would draw 0-0. Pochettino’s managerial career was up and running. In the away leg the following week, Espanyol lost 3-2 and, when Pochettino took his team back to the Camp Nou in La Liga at the end of February, he was still searching for his first win. On a memorable occasion, they would win 2-1 . Espanyol have not beaten Barcelona since. “The 0-0 against Barcelona was a fantastic result and it was then easy to convince the players to play in a different way,” Pochettino said. “Where did I get the idea we had to press them? It’s about your personality, who you are. You show on the pitch who you are. If you are brave in your life, you cannot behave in a different way on the pitch. I don’t understand how to play in a different way. Always, be brave. I like to be brave.” Pochettino had many battles with Guardiola when they were players with Espanyol and Barcelona respectively, and many more once they had crossed over into management at the two clubs. Pochettino was a part of the Espanyol team that beat Sir Bobby Robson’s Barcelona 2-0 at home in 1997 and there is footage of him on YouTube monstering into a challenge on the Brazilian Ronaldo. But that match, plus his first victory in management, have represented his only successes against Guardiola, who brings his Manchester City team to White Hart Lane on Sunday for a top-of-the-table collision. Pochettino won 4-1 in the corresponding fixture last September , when City were managed by Manuel Pellegrini, and it was a result that energised Tottenham. But it feels as though the stakes have been raised again, largely because, well, City have Guardiola and they have looked imperious this season. It will be another occasion when Pochettino demands bravery from his players and another one in which he will hope to see evidence that they can get the better of a powerhouse. Pochettino’s stated aim for the season is to win the title. “The big challenge for us is to try to win the league,” he said, two weeks ago. On Friday, he was quick to say that nobody ought to read too much into the City result. It remained too early in the season, he said. But imagine the reaction if Tottenham were to win? Pochettino’s team have started well and there are a clutch of factors that fire the belief that it could be their year, chief among them the sense that, despite their lofty early season position, they have not yet truly clicked – apart from in the 4-0 win at Stoke City . They have dug out most of their results, showing plenty of personality. There is more to come, which is a good sign. Related: Tottenham Hotspur v Manchester City: match preview Pochettino’s squad also has greater strength in depth, following the club’s summer transfer business, which was characterised by the desire to build from a position – and in positions – of strength. The club had excellent midfielders last season but they still spent a combined £41m on Victor Wanyama and Moussa Sissoko. More than ever, with the demands of a Champions League campaign, it is a squad game, and the squad was needed on Tuesday. Pochettino was without five key players for the high-pressure Champions League tie at CSKA Moscow but a remark from Hugo Lloris spoke volumes. “From the first minute I saw the teamsheet, I never thought about the missing players,” the captain said. Tottenham won 1-0. Pochettino’s promotion of academy-developed players has created a connection with the fans and a feelgood factor, and then there is the defence, which was the joint-most miserly in last season’s Premier League and is the most miserly so far this time. Jan Vertonghen notes how he has played “maybe three-quarters” of his career matches with Toby Alderweireld, his Belgium and former Ajax team-mate, and their central defensive partnership has come to be characterised by steel and understanding. Title-winning teams are built on strong centre-half pairings and they are ready to take on Sergio Agüero, who has 10 goals in nine league games against Tottenham. The Champions League has brought excitement and opportunity but also tremendous extra pressure, both mental and physical. It felt significant, and a little worrying, that Eric Dier and Mousa Dembélé both suffered injuries against Sunderland after the Champions League opener against Monaco. Pochettino has spoken about how there will be less rotation this season, because players are not OK about sitting out Champions League ties. Related: Pep Guardiola tells Manchester City players effort levels must not drop Tottenham’s biggest concern, at present, involves the lack of clinical edge – can Vincent Janssen score enough goals in the absence of the injured Harry Kane? – while there is the wider question of whether their rivals might simply be driving improvements at quicker rates. Ahead of City’s visit, though, the rhetoric from the dressing-room was heavy on self-belief. “It’s true that the Guardiola effect took place very early at City but we are more focused on ourselves,” Lloris said. “We know that we are able to do great things against top teams. In front of our crowd, anything is possible.” Pochettino’s duel with Guardiola is one of the principal subplots and the paths that they have taken to Sunday’s showdown have been markedly different. Shortly before he got the Espanyol job, Pochettino completed his Uefa Pro License with a spell as the assistant manager to the club’s ladies’ team while after Espanyol he took over at Southampton, who had also been in a lowly position. Guardiola, by contrast, went from Barcelona B to Barcelona, where he inherited Messi & Co. “Guardiola is the face of a new managerial era, in which the vision of romantic football was mixed with [the appliance of] new technology,” Pochettino said. “He is the face but it’s not only Guardiola. I have been involved and [so have] different managers like Luis Enrique and Diego Simeone. We are the same age and in the same level. Guardiola was the face because [good] results always put you at the top. I think always you can see better when you have Messi in your team.” It is not difficult to detect professional tension between Pochettino, the fighting Argentinian, and Guardiola, the gilded son of Catalonia. The playing field feels more level than when they met in Spain. Pochettino is determined to make a statement."

         "Chelsea’s Antonio Conte says he has no magic wand to solve team’s problems \nChelsea’s Antonio Conte says he has no magic wand to solve team’s problems \nAntonio Conte has said he cannot wave ‘a magic wand’ to solve the defensive issues which have undermined Chelsea’s progress this season \nAntonio Conte has warned there can be no quick fix to solve Chelsea’s underlying problems this season and stressed the need for patience in a series of face-to-face meetings with the owner, Roman Abramovich, at the club’s base in Cobham. Abramovich was present to watch the first team train three times this week, meeting Conte over lunch in the facility’s canteen on each occasion to discuss the manager’s plans to revive a flagging side. The owner, who has made 11 managerial changes in 13 years, remains supportive of the Italian and sympathetic as to the scale of the task, exposed by defeats by Liverpool and Arsenal in their past two Premier League matches. There is a willingness to fund significant purchases in future transfer windows, as well as to move on those senior players who have underachieved over the last 14 months but Conte, who has practised with a back three in training this week, is painfully realistic about the need for time to work on improving the current crop. “It’s not a surprise,” he said when asked whether he had anticipated that the team might toil after his appointment in July. “Usually, when you change manager, it means you have a problem. So, when you arrive at the place who called you to solve their problems, you know you must face this situation. “Sometimes you can be happy and solve the situation very quickly. Sometimes you need to have time to solve the situation. It’s important to understand how many problems you find when you arrive in a new team. “In my life my story shows that I haven’t ever found an easy situation [when I’ve come in]. Even so, there was an expectation to improve on last season. That was my expectation too. But my experience, as a footballer and a manager, tells me to have a bit of patience to continue to work, to improve, to find the right way and solve things. It won’t be easy. It’s normal but I’m confident. I have a group of players who want to work and show the right commitment.” Conte would appear to have faced similar issues when he returned to Juventus, where his career as a player had flourished, as manager in 2011. He had inherited a squad who had finished seventh in successive campaigns and famously, on his first day in charge, assembled his new players to deliver the succinct message: “Lads, it’s time we stopped being shit.” Conte vented his anger at his Chelsea team at half-time at the Emirates Stadium last Saturday, when the visitors already trailed 3-0, with his frustration born partly out of the fact he considers this group more talented than the side he took over in Turin. “Juventus, for two years, had finished seventh and the value of the players is not the same,” he said. “The talent that there is now in our team, at Chelsea, for sure is more than Juventus in my first season. But, also, we must understand that you don’t win just with talent. With talent you must add running, intensity, sacrifice, wanting to win the ball when you lose it … all of this. We are working very hard on these aspects to improve them. It’s important to understand and find very quickly the right way. “If we think we can solve this situation without work, because we have a magician [in charge] … well, it’s not my habit to hope to improve the situation without work. I think the situation we can improve only with work, with great work. We are doing this. In these two months we are doing this. Slowly, slowly, we are understanding this. I’m confident I have a group of players who have great commitment and who work hard.” Chelsea will still be without John Terry at Hull City on Saturday as the captain continues his rehabilitation from ankle ligament damage. Conte has experimented playing David Luiz, Gary Cahill and Branislav Ivanovic in a back three in training, and will consider handing Marcos Alonso his first Premier League start for the club at the KCom Stadium. The Italian could become the first Chelsea manager to drop Ivanovic from his lineup on the basis of poor form since André Villas-Boas in 2013. Regardless, Cahill, whose error at Arsenal handed the hosts their opening goal, will retain his place. “I don’t like to single out players for individual mistakes,” Conte said. “We lose and we win together. We must understand this. If someone makes a mistake, together we must help him and solve the situation. Against Arsenal we had 80 minutes to recover from the mistake. Cahill is a good player, a great defender. I trust him and he plays tomorrow.” Related: Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekend"

There’s an awful lot of things needing to be fixed at this club but I think they can be fixed, I really do.” Related: Sunderland v West Bromwich Albion: match preview Moyes believes the rapid turnover in managers – it is a year since Dick Advocaat resigned in despair – explains Sunderland’s constant battles against relegation. “The revolving door needs to be stopped,” he said. “Things need to be put right but to change them there needs to be a period of stability.” He sets great store by “honesty” and the team’s supporters and players are having to accept his refusal to sugar coat reality. “My words could be interpreted as too downbeat,” Moyes acknowledged after pointing out that Januzaj’s absence for a minimum of six weeks with ankle ligament damage will hardly enhance his side’s creativity. “But honest is all I can be. I think people would rather you tell the truth than untruths. “The players have had to take criticism from me. We need a really committed team and a team that can concentrate. At the moment I don’t know what I’m going to get from my team.” Moyes is unsure how Cattermole – who has had an epidural injection in an attempt to ease a back problem which causes him severe leg pain – will be absent for, but he is adamant that the recent resignations of Ishtiaq Rehman, Sunderland’s former doctor, and Danny Philpott, the assistant academy director, should not reflect badly on the club. Related: Sunderland doctor leaves club following Patrick van Aanholt incident “The doctor situation was something I was aware of before I came in,” he said. “He’s had some really difficult decisions in recent weeks and I think his feeling is maybe that it was time to go. Danny Philpott had come in with the idea of getting the main [academy] job but they [Sunderland’s board] didn’t want that. Whatever decisions are made, the club will only ever do things for the best. Martin [Bain, the chief executive] is a correct fella. I can only say, anything he’s doing, he’s doing for the right reasons.” In the wake of this week’s revelations regarding alleged corruption in football, Moyes has called for great transfer market transparency. “When a transfer is completed let’s get what the club has had to pay the agent straight out there,” he said. “I think there might be a few gasps from supporters and the media. “I’m not condoning what’s been revealed this week but it might actually be small stuff compared to what else is going on, to some of the money being given to agents to do deals. I’m amazed at how many agents are representing the same player – there could be 25 and they say they’re acting as ‘intermediaries’. Maybe that’s why the agents’ fees are bigger, because everyone’s getting paid down the line – this year’s been one of the worst for that.”"

Guardiola takes City to Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday in a game that features his Premier League leaders against Mauricio Pochettino’s second-placed side. City drew 3-3 at Celtic in Wednesday’s Champions League group game to end their run of victories at 10. Afterwards Fernandinho said Guardiola’s insistence on a high intensity in training and matches meant “sometimes we go a little bit down, sometimes we are up”, though he added that squad and coach were working to attain the requisite level. Related: Mauricio Pochettino to face Guardiola as an equal in a rivalry born in Barcelona The Brazilian’s comments regarding the dip in quality were put to Guardiola and he was asked if this was acceptable. “No. I don’t accept that,” the 45-year-old said. “I wouldn’t be happy. I want it to be the principle in all of our games. “That’s why the player has to take care of themselves in their private life, sleep well, eat well, because the way we play is so demanding. People cannot escape; [if they do not take care] another one has to be there. The way I want to play is that way and it’s much more simple to improve. But for the 90 minutes the players have to put in absolutely everything on the field. That’s the most important moment in their lives. Training is a part of it but the most important thing is the referee’s whistle and you start to play.” Guardiola was proud of his players’ effort at Parkhead. “The fans for Man City were disappointed because they didn’t win but were happy with what they saw,” he said. “They saw until the last moment they tried to win. That is what I am after – until the last minute try to win the games; it doesn’t matter what happened. At the end I went to the locker room and I think the players were tired, they were exhausted, so much so that they couldn’t talk and that is what I want from my players because in the end all our fans know that and that is why I cannot be disappointed in our performance in Glasgow.” Guardiola is an admirer of Pochettino and the high-pressing football Spurs play. “What I saw with Tottenham is one who, along with Liverpool, one of the best teams at the moment playing in the Premier League,” he said. “We need a good performance to win there. We cannot achieve points if we are not making a good performance. If you are so-so, no chance. “What I like is the teams who are active and you see that when they play. They want the ball, want to keep it, are so aggressive without the ball. I like to see that and Tottenham and Liverpool are both teams in that way.” Despite winning all previous six league matches Guardiola remains guarded. “We won most of our games because of our enthusiasm,” he said. “At the start a new coach wins a lot of games but to create something stable, more controlled, you need more time. In my first year in Barcelona we won six titles [trophies] in a row but by my fourth year we were better than my first year. “In my third year in Munich we were better than my first year. You see the teams and the way we play. I am pretty sure that in my second and third year here we will be better than we are now. The results are almost perfect now but the performances will improve more over time. Now we won six games in a row and people say we are going to win four titles in the first season. “How many clubs have done that in their first season? How many? Zero. It is so difficult. We are going to try to win the game but in my last period here the football will be better. I am sure of that.” Guardiola is conscious that by the second year the initial enthusiasm that players show for a coach wanes, making it important to have laid solid foundations regarding the ethos. “Pochettino is better now than when he arrived because he had time and we need time but we sometimes don’t get time. That is the big problem we have. That is why the enthusiasm is so important. In the second year the enthusiasm is gone, it disappears, that is going to happen. I am tired of the players, they are tired of me.” Guardiola has a three-year contract and indicated when he may decide to stay longer. “When I decided to say goodbye to Barcelona and Bayern Munich I decided in the last year,” he said. “I said: ‘OK, it’s enough.’”"
